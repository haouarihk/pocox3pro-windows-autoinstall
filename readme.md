# Automatic script to install windows on poco x3 pro:
WE ARE NOT RELIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES,
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

## NoTes:
- This script will delete everything, better backup your cat pics.
- This script is not gurantee to work every time, use it at your own risk.
- While the script is running, DO NOT PLUG ANY USB DEVICE OR DRIVE.


## Requirements:
- unlocked phone
- pc with usb c cable
- a poco x3 pro



## How to use:
- clone the repo, or download as a zip file and extract it
- get a windows arm iso from uudp or something, and put it in the working directory, rename it to `windows-arm.iso`
- run `run.bat` file as administrator


## Other scripts:
- If you just want to know specifications of your device (panel type, ram, storage), you can use `show-specifications.bat`. (run as administrator)
- if you just want to reinstall windows, without doing the repartitioning, use the `reinstall-windows.bat`. (run as administrator)
- if you want to just install the drivers, without doing anything else, use the `reinstall-drivers.bat`. (run as administrator)



## Issues:
- can't detect the phone reliably from diskpart.
- the script needs cleaning.
